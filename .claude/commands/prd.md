description: Implement a PRD from docs/prd, or draft it for review if it does not exist yet
argument-hint: '[PRD id, e.g. P0-A]'
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Work on PRD `$ARGUMENTS`.

## First, resolve the id

- **No id given** — read the "Where things stand" section of `docs/prd/README.md`, say what
  you think the next PRD should be and why, and stop. Do not start work.
- **No file, but the id has a row in the index table** — Draft mode.
- **Neither** — the id is not in the backlog. Say so and ask whether to add it, rather than
  inventing a PRD for an id nobody has agreed to.
- **The file exists** — route on its `status`, not on the fact that it exists:
  - `accepted` or `in-progress` — Implement mode.
  - `draft` — **the spec has not been signed off.** Review mode. Do not implement it. If I
    tell you to proceed anyway, say in your summary that you implemented a draft, so the
    record shows the review was skipped.
  - `shipped` — say so and ask what is intended: a follow-up belongs in a new PRD, and a
    correction to a shipped record usually means superseding it.
  - `superseded` — point at `superseded_by` and stop.

## Draft mode

Write the PRD. Do not implement it.

1. Read `docs/prd/_TEMPLATE.md` for section order, `.agents/prd-author.md` for the rules,
   and one reviewed PRD — `P0-A-reconcile-claims.md` or `P1-A-kms-key-provider.md` — for
   register.
2. Read `docs/adr/` so the design does not silently contradict a decision, and
   `docs/STATUS.md` so the Problem section starts from what is actually behind each claim.
3. Verify every claim you make about this repo against the source before writing it. A PRD
   whose Problem section is wrong is worse than no PRD, because it will be trusted.
4. Write `docs/prd/<id>-<slug>.md` and update its row in the index. `size` and `status` must
   match the frontmatter in both places.
5. Run `yarn lint:docs` and `yarn format:check`.
6. **Commit the draft**, then stop and hand it to me for review. Leave `status: draft`.
   An uncommitted draft cannot be diffed, cannot be reviewed as a change, and is one stray
   `git checkout` from gone.

Tell me explicitly what you were unsure about — a PRD I approve without knowing where it was
guessing is worse than one that flags its own soft spots.

## Review mode

The PRD exists and is `draft`. **Say so in your first line** — `/prd <id>` is the same
command for both, and someone who expected code needs to know why they are reading a review.

1. **Re-verify the PRD's factual claims at HEAD before forming an opinion on them.** Every
   file:line reference, every dependency claim, every count. A draft's claims were true when
   written and are the part most likely to have rotted; they are also the part the
   implementer will trust without checking.
2. Read `docs/adr/` and `.context/conventions.md`. A PRD that contradicts a written
   convention is not a PRD problem to note in passing — one of the two has to move, and
   saying which is part of the review.
3. **Apply your corrections to the file and commit them.** Do not hand me a list of defects
   and a question. Leave `status: draft`.
4. Where a correction is a judgement call rather than a fact, make the call, apply it, and
   say in your summary what you decided and what the alternative was. I can reverse a
   decision I can see; I cannot act on one you left open.
5. Run `yarn lint:docs` and `yarn format:check`.
6. Report: what you verified, what you changed and why, and anything you could not settle
   from inside the repo — a claim needing GCP credentials, a decision that is mine. Then say
   plainly that accepting it means setting `status: accepted` in the frontmatter and the
   index row, after which `/prd <id>` implements.

---

## Implement mode

1. **Read the PRD first, then push back before writing code.** Tell me anything in it that
   is wrong, underspecified, or that you would do differently. This is the cheapest moment
   to catch a bad spec.
2. **Acceptance criteria are the contract.** Everything in them, nothing outside them. If
   you find a real problem that is out of scope, name the PRD that owns it and note it in
   that PRD's risks — do not fix it here and do not silently drop it.
3. **Re-verify before acting on the PRD's factual claims.** They were true when written;
   another PRD may have closed some since.
4. Anything touching `packages/crypto-core/`, `packages/audit-core/`, `src/crypto/`,
   `src/audit/`, keysets, or `infra/` goes through `.agents/security-reviewer.md` before it
   is called done. `AGENTS.md` has the routing rule.
5. Work in small commits with real messages, following `.context/conventions.md`.
6. Run `yarn typecheck`, `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, `yarn lint:docs`, and `yarn format:check`
   before calling it done. If the PRD touches the API, run the e2e suite against a fresh
   database as well.
7. Walk the acceptance criteria one by one and say which are met, and on which axis. If one
   is not, say so plainly rather than reporting the task complete.

## Both modes: close the loop

Before you finish, update:

- the PRD's `status` in frontmatter,
- its row in the `docs/prd/README.md` index (the lint enforces that these agree),
- every `docs/STATUS.md` row the work moved, with evidence that resolves at HEAD,
- the **"Where things stand"** section at the top of the index, including its date.

And tell me: **what did you have to work out that `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/STATUS.md`,
`.context/`, or `CLAUDE.md` should have told you?** Anything on that list is a gap in the
scaffolding, and closing it is part of the task, not an afterthought.
